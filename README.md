BEFORE:

This is an assignment for the Odin Project. I am supposed to decontstruct the Google.com homepage -- the one where it's just a search bar -- and rebuild it on my own. In this assignment I will practice my HTML and CSS skills and even construct a form.

AFTER:

The project is completed and I have moved on to the next lesson. Working this project made it evident that my practice on FreeCodeCamp was not in vain. I felt more in control of the elements on the DOM than I had in previous projects. I also felt like I had a good feel for managing and assigning CSS styles to various elements. Finally, I used Git to update the page and styles, after uploading the bulk of the project initially. It was good to practice the git skills.
